In this directory we collect benchmark scripts for extensive automated 
regression tests. Once the ACE.jl codebase stabilizes a bit we will 
require regression tests to allow merging of PRs.

* `benchmarks.jl` collects all the benchmarks into a single large bm suite. 
* `run_benchmarks.jl` is just an example script, and not necessarily what should be run.
