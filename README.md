### Transformed Jacobi Polynomials

We start from completely standard Jacobi polynomials Jn(x); our implementation simply follows the description on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials). The recursion coefficients are generated using `big` (`BigFloat` and `BigInt`). This may be unnecessary and should be investigated at some point.

However, the `Jn(x)` only form the starting point. To construct the `r`-basis, we transform them as follows:

- transform a distance r to a transformed distance `t(r)`; this is the "distance-transform" and stored in `TransformedJacobi.trans`
- Then we set `x = -1 + 2*(t-tl)/(tu-tl)` which linearly transforms `t` to `[-1,1]` with 1 always corresponding to the cut-off radius `ru`.
- Then we evaluate the Jacobi-polynomials Jn(x) taken w.r.t to an inner product C(x) = (1-x)^a (1+x)^b.
- This C(x) also acts as a cut-off! That, Pn(x) = C(x) Jn(x) are orthogonal w.r.t. the L2-inner product and for a, b > 0 are zero at the end-points. (Ack: this is an idea due to Markus Bachmayr.)
- Finally, these transformed and cut-off-multiplied polynomials Pn(x) form our basis functions in the `r` variable.

### Spherical Harmonics

We implement standard complex spherical harmonics; our code is a straightforward modification of [SphericalHarmonics.jl](https://github.com/milthorpe/SphericalHarmonics.jl), including fixing some type instabilities for speed. This package follows the same design principle as most of the `SHIPs.jl` code of using buffer arrays for various precomputations and fast computation of multiple basis functions at the same time.

There is another spherical harmonics package which we did not know about when starting to write `SHIPs.jl` but which we should look at to see whether it contains useful ideas [SphericalHarmonics.jl](https://github.com/hofmannmartin/SphericalHarmonics.jl).

### `SHIPBasis`

The basis functions are defined as follows:
```
Z_klm(R) = P_k(r) Y_lm(RÃÇ)      # k, l, m :: Int
A_klm = ‚àë_j Z_klm(R_j)         # k, l, m :: Int
B_kl = ‚àë_m C_lm ‚àè_a A_k‚Çêl‚Çêm‚Çê   # k, l, m :: Tuple{Int} or Vector{Int}
```
The klm values are restriced as follows:
* For every k,l, the m values range through -l:l.
* k + wY l <= D  where D is a prescribe total degree.

For more information  on how a `SHIPBasis` is constructed and stored, see
`?SHIPBasis`.


### `SHIP` : the fast implementation of a SHIP calculator

While, for training, we use the `SHIPBasis` type, for simulation we convert
this to the `SHIP` type. The idea is to rewrite the site energy as
```
E = ‚àë_ùê§ùê•ùê¶ c_ùê§ùê•ùê¶ ‚àè_a A_k‚Çêl‚Çêk‚Çê
```
and avoid the inner loop over `m` (for given ùê§,ùê•). The coefficients
`c_ùê§ùê•ùê¶` are precomputed in the construction of the `SHIP` type, in particular
no more Clebsch-Gordan evaluations are required after this.

The key point however is that computing the gradients of all basis functions is
much more expensive than computing the gradient of a site energy using the above
identity. Gradients based on the `SHIP` type are very efficient to compute as
follows (pseudo-code)
```
(1) Precompute {A_k}
(2) Precompute ‚àá_Rj œï_{klm}
    (precomputing ‚àá_rj J_k and ‚àá_Rj Y_lm is in fact enough)
(3) 
```
